### GTK (Simple)AnimatedSpriteViewer

- This very simple AnimatedSpriteViewer crops single frames out of a sprite sheet and renders the frames one by one.
- You can specify
	- the **overall amount of images** contained by the sprite sheet
	- the amount of images in **x-direction**
	- the amount of images in **y-direction**
	- the **FPS** the animation should be played with
- Since this project is only a viewer it is not possible to edit/ change/ save the animation or the sprite sheet
- In future versions I might support animation sets like
	-  walk_right > frames [1..8]
	-  walk_left > frames [9..16]
	-  ...

This project was realized by **Daniel Steegmueller** for the Object Oriented Scripting Language course at the University of Applied Science LÃ¼beck.
